                <p>Saddled with medical debt? L.A. County is looking to take it off your hands.

                    The county government on Tuesday became the latest municipality to consider wiping out residents’ long-lingering medical bills by buying up the debt at a steep discount. The Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to ask county executives to explore purchasing and forgiving the more than $2 billion constituents owe in unpaid medical expenses.
                    
                    Supervisor Janice Hahn, who brought the motion along with Supervisor Holly Mitchell, said she believed the county could erase the debt for pennies on the dollar.
                    The vote follows a county report released in June that found 810,000 county residents — roughly 1 in 10 adults— have outstanding medical debt. A disproportionate percentage were Black and Latino.

                    The bills were often incurred during some unexpected, unbudgeted-for event — emergency room trips or an overnight hospital stay. Residents with these unpaid bills were more likely to go hungry, struggle to keep their housing and skip their medication, according to the report. Nearly half of those surveyed said the bills stopped them from buying basic necessities.
                    
                    According to the report, county residents had racked up more than $2.6 billion in medical debt as of 2021, the most recent year for which data were available. To buy $2 billion of it, the Department of Public Health estimates officials would need to spend $24 million.
                    
                    When hospitals can’t collect on unpaid bills, they will sometimes bundle the debt and sell it at a steep discount to a collection agency. (The older the debt, the greater the discount.) These agencies will then try and collect the face-value amount from the debtor and pocket the profit.</p>
